# Traffic Light Classifier Project (Final project for the Introduction to Self-Driving-Cars Engineer Nanodegree)

This is a traffic light classifier project using Python and basic OpenCV2 techniques to recognize traffic lights. And it is also part of the final project of the Udacity's Introduction to Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

In this project, knowledge of computer vision techniques is used to build a classifier for images of traffic lights.

Here are some sample images from the dataset (from left to right: red, green, and yellow traffic lights):

# Project had 2 criterias to pass :
  -More than 90% accuracy
  -Never misclassify red lights as green
I achieved 91% accuracy.
