# Traffic Light Classifier Project (Final project for the Introduction to Self-Driving-Cars Engineer Nanodegree)

This is a traffic light classifier project using Python and basic OpenCV2 techniques to recognize traffic lights. And it is also part of the final project of the Udacity's Introduction to Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

In this project, knowledge of computer vision techniques is used to build a classifier for images of traffic lights.

# 1. Loading and Visualizing the Traffic Light Dataset
This traffic light dataset consists of 1484 number of color images in 3 categories - red, yellow, and green. As with most human-sourced data, the data is not evenly distributed among the types. There are:

904 red traffic light images
536 green traffic light images
44 yellow traffic light images
